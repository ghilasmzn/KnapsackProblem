It then returns to the last object visited and then repeats the procedure. The path stops when all the objects S have been visited. In short, the exploration progresses from an object S by calling itself recursively for each neighboring object of S.\n\nOn the other hand, the breadth-first search starts from a source node. Then it lists all the neighbors of the source, to then explore them one by one. In contrast, the in-depth journey actually explores each path one by one. For these two approaches, a queue is used to place the different objects in the order they arrive.",

So in this branching tree, we start with a root node that represents our original problem. That original problem is actually the linear relaxation of our original problem.So each node represents a subproblem, and we write down the solution inside the box, So once we have that, every time when we branch a variable, we're going to create two child nodes by adding two constraints.\n\n[![t-l-charger.png](https://i.postimg.cc/xTpyBmSS/t-l-charger.png)](https://postimg.cc/mtMHHtDd)\n\nafter we solve the first probleme let call it P1 we get fractional solution, so we add two constraints to create subproblem P2 and P3, if we see P3 have unfeasible solution, it mean it have been solved, so no reason to keep branching on P3. but for P2 the solution is still fractional. If the P2 solution is less than root P1 solution, so we probably need to do something more to solve problem P2, So there are some other things that we may observe. So z2, If you plug in x2 back into your objective function, you are going to get z2 < z1. What does that mean? That's actually a general case. This is a maximization problem, And for a maximization problem, once we add a constraint into an existing program, we are restricting our Earth more. And once we do that, we're not going to do as good as our original case, So in general, when we branch to a new level, that objective value would decrease, at least a weekly decrease.\n\n\n[![t-l-charger-1.png](https://i.postimg.cc/nhQ75wkv/t-l-charger-1.png)](https://postimg.cc/mPBt1jKD)\n\n\nCode Explanation :\nThe queue is traversed in depth or in breadth.\n\nThen If the optimal value is greater than the value of max_profit:\n* we create a new branch which will be the left child\n* the level of the branch is added with that of its parent\n* we add the value of the parent + the value of the list of items of the same level.\n* we add the weight of the parent + the weight of the list of items of the same level\n* we copy the sequence of selected items\n* then we add the branch to these parents\n* don't forget to increment the nodes_generated variable in order to see the number of nodes in the tree\n* then we start again to look for a new optimal value with the new branch\n\nin the case where the value is maximum:\n* we indicate the side of the branch in the node\n* then we add the branch to the queue\n\nin the case where the value of the maximum branch but the weight is less than the capacity of the knapsack:\n* the value of the branch and inject into the max_profit variable which will be our new comparison value.\n\nthen the same procedure is carried out with the right branch.",
